## Provenance Marketplace

## Title
Provenance Marketplace is a platform that transforms real-world assets into collateral using ERC1155 standard. The tokens generated will include both fungible and non-fungible tokens. The fungible tokens can be traded on other platforms for different digital assets and can also serve various purposes, such as acting as collateral for loans.
